# Assignment 1
## CS 648 Assignment 1

### Overview
Assignment 1 was creating a simple web page for Vecta Corp.[^v] using HTML.  
This assignment also required the completion of a [Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) in which I learned a whole lot of neat commands to make README files cleaner.

Now I know the secret to making beautiful README files that I always come across when exploring third-party libraries on Github.

### Assignment Details
1.	Create a new HTML file (index.html).
2.	Add all the necessary HTML5 code to your web page by using the Emmet[^e] shortcut of !+Tab.  
3.	Give your page a unique title such as  
    >Welcome to Vecta Corp. â€“ 24/7 365 turnkey vSolutions for your agile ebusiness.
4.	In the project files download you will have a home.txt file. Copy the text into the `<body>` tag of your page. Wrap the Welcome text in a `<h1>` tag. Wrap the rest of the text in a `<p>` tag. Save your work.

[^v]: Vecta Corp is a made up entity that the web page is built around. ***NOT A REAL COMPANY***
[^e]: [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) is a great VSCode extension that makes developing HTML docs much easier.
